# Code Refactor Starter Code
Added alt attibutes to each image and fixed the broken link on the Search Engine Optimaztion.

Consolidaed the benifits section in the CSS page.

Added a few notes in the CSS page.

Added a Title to the html code.

Added more notes to CSS style sheet and took away code.

Reduced CSS coding down further and reduced code in html.

Went back to start fresh from the added Title portion messed up the page to bad.

Blended the Hero/content section in the html and CSS.

Changed the padding in the benifits section to get it to line up properly.

So though out this project I was able to clean up the html page by addin the alt's that was missing fixed the broken link. I was also able to reduce the classes that was being used to make it more user friendly to the next tech. In return to reducing the classes I was able to blend a good portion of the CSS style together. I also went in and added notes to the CSS and the html so to make things easier to find. When going though the CSS I noticed that there were several rules that we put in diffrent places that had no need for that. I took the rules and moved then to the proper sections to make finding things easier. I have set the page up with a live link which can be found here: <a href="https://teller35.github.io/urban-octo-telegram/">Live link</a>.
